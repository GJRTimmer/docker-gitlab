GitLab CE is set up in the Docker image using the [install from source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/install/installation.md) method as documented in the the official GitLab documentation.

For other methods to install GitLab please refer to the [Official GitLab Installation Guide](https://about.gitlab.com/installation/) which includes a [GitLab image for Docker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/tree/master/docker).
